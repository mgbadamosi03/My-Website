    <p style="color: #f9f8fc;">My Name is Mayowa Gbadamosi but most call me Mo. I am currently a freshman at The George Washington University. At The George Washington University, I am majoring in Business Analytics with a concentration in Information Systems. In high school, I was the Vice President of the Investment club which dealt with the schools money. At GWU, I hope to play a part in the investment banking club as well as other business related clubs. I believe that I can do the work and deliver great results. I am a great team member and don't mind taking charge when needed, and i posess a combination of skills, including R Studio, Excel, and VS Code. </p>
    <p style="color: #f9f8fc;">I am familiar with the Washington D.C Area since my sister attended GW as well. The start of my east coast transition began in 2017 when I started at my boarding school Woodberry Forest School. However, I did not always live on the east coast. I was born in Sacramento, California and spent my whole life prior to boarding school living there. In my free time, though, I enjoy going to concerts, playing soccer, and going to the movies.  </p>
